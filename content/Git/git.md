If you have ever tried to learn about git, you will probably
have faced the very same situation once and over again. There
are lots of posts and tutorials teaching the basics, and some
showcasing the advanced stuff. The first ones cover all the
basic operation without assuming any prior knowledge, while
the latter ones assume too much. there is not middle ground.


If this is your case, I'll try and put an end to that cycle.
If it's not, hey! I may save you the frustration!


Throughout this series of posts I will present you with
some practical exercises along with the bits of theory needed
to get to know every corner of this awesome piece of technology


But first things first. What is this git and why should you
spend your time learning it?
